The visual editor widget for Wordpress.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a new `Visual Editor` widget type that allows you to insert rich text and media elements in your sidebars with no hassle. The default WordPress text widget lacks of functionalities and it requires HTML knowledge, this plugin was born to overcome these limitations. With Black Studio TinyMCE Widget you will be able to edit your widgets in a WYSIWYG manner using the native WordPress TinyMCE editor, just like you do in posts and pages. And if you are a developer you may still switch back and forth from Visual to HTML mode.

* Switch between Visual mode and HTML mode (including Quicktags toolbar)
* Insert images, videos and other media from WordPress Media Library

* Option to "Automatically add paragraphs" to widget text
* Support for shortcodes, smilies and embed in widget text (including preview)
* Support for responsive images (on WordPress 4.4 or later)
* Support for Customizer with live preview and quick edit
* Support for fullscreen editing mode
* Support for widgets accessibility mode
* Compatible with multi-site (WordPress networks)
* Compatible with common multi-language plugins (WPML, Polylang and WPGlobus)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Purpose of the plugin =

This plugin gives you the ability to use the WordPress visual editor (TinyMCE) in widgets as you do in posts and pages, but it doesn't affect the editor behavior itself or its functionalities. If you are looking for additional editor features, take a look at plugins like [WP Edit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-edit/), [TinyMCE Advanced](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/) or any other feature specific plugin you may need. Any additional TinyMCE plugin written following WordPress guidelines should work fine with Black Studio TinyMCE Widget.

= Troubleshooting =

If you are experiencing issues with the plugin please read entirely these FAQ before posting a new topic in our [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/black-studio-tinymce-widget). Most of the times issues are caused by incompatibility with other plugins or themes, which may prevent our plugin from working as expected. In order to troubleshoot issues please complete the following steps:

1. First, ensure you have understood the purpose of the plugin (see above). If you are experiencing issues with the editor even when editing posts or pages, they're definitely not related to our plugin, which only works for widgets (unless you're using additional plugins that provides widgets support for pages, i.e. [Page Builder by SiteOrigin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/siteorigin-panels/)).
2. Ensure that you are running the latest versions of both WordPress and the plugin.
3. Search in our [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/black-studio-tinymce-widget) for threads with similar issues.
4. Disable all other plugins and check if the problem is fixed. In that case enable the other plugins one by one and figure out which one is causing the issue. Please see [Conflict Diagnosis Guide for WordPress plugins](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/docs/troubleshooting/conflict-diagnosis-guide-wordpress-plugins/) for further info.
5. If the problem persists even with all other plugins disabled, try to switch to a WordPress default theme (i.e. Twenty Fifteen) and check if that fixes the issue.

If you found a conflict with a plugin or theme, or if your problem is still present after the steps above, open a topic in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/black-studio-tinymce-widget) and provide the following information:

* Detailed description of the problem, including the steps to reproduce it
* Location(s) where the problem occurs (Appearance -> Widgets, Customizer, Accessibility mode, Page Builder, etc)
* Error messages, if any, in particular in [browser's javascript console](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers)
* Browser and Operating System in use
* Plugin version in use
* WordPress version in use
* WordPress theme in use
* WordPress language in use, if other than english
* WordPress plugins causing conflicts, if any
* A link to a screenshot, if it can be useful to understand the problem
* A link to your website, if it can be useful to show the problem

= Can't find it in available widgets =

Since version 1.3.1 the name of the widget changed from `Black Studio TinyMCE Widget` to `Visual Editor` to enhance user friendliness. `Black Studio TinyMCE Widget` is still the name of the plugin, but it was a bit too long and not very intuitive for inexperienced users. You may find references to the old name in articles and videos on the web, so don't panic if you don't see the `Black Studio TinyMCE Widget` in your available widgets, just look for `Visual Editor`. Note: if you are using WordPress in a language other than english you may have a corresponding name translated in your language.

= Widgets disappeared after migrating or changing the site URL =

When dealing with a WordPress site URL change it is necessary to face the serialized fields issue: data may become corrupted if using a simple search/replace (see the [Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Moving_WordPress#When_Your_Domain_Name_or_URLs_Change) for further info). This is not an issue specifically related to our plugin, but it affects all the parts (plugins, themes and WordPress core files too) that use serialized data archiviation. When changing the site URL, the recommended way is to use the [Search and Replace for WordPress Databases Script](https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/), as suggested by the Codex.

= How to translate widgets in multi-language sites =

The current version of Black Studio TinyMCE Widget supports the following multi-language plugins:

* WPML
* Polylang
* WPGlobus

**WPML**

[WPML](https://wpml.org) is the leading commercial plugin for WordPress multi-language sites.
If you're using WPML, we recommend to install also the 3rd party [WPML Widgets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpml-widgets/) plugin, which will allow you to create widgets and assign them to specific languages, keeping the ability to work with the visual editor.
Alternatively you may use the WPML String Translation plugin, provided by the WPML team. In this case, you'll have to create the widgets in the widgets admin panel, using the Visual Editor provided by the Black Studio TinyMCE Widget plugin, and then go to WPML => String Translation and translate title and body of widgets. If you installed WPML after the creation of the widgets, just re-save them and they will appear on the String Translation list. Unfortunately the WPML String Translation interface has no Visual Editor, that's why we no longer recommend this method. If you were using WPML String Translation, we recommend to switch to WPML Widgets and remove the entries in WPML String Translation list after you moved them to be real widgets.

**Polylang**

[Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) is a free alternative to WPML that allows you to create bilingual or multilingual WordPress sites. It provides natively the ability to assign languages to each widget (including the ones created with Black Studio TinyMCE Widget), so you won't need any additional plugin to have multi-language widgets.

**WPGlobus**

[WPGlobus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpglobus/) is a new WordPress plugin for multi-language sites, with a different approach in comparison to WPML and Polylang. The WPGlobus team has also created the [WPGlobus for Black Studio TinyMCE Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpglobus-for-black-studio-tinymce-widget/) addon plugin, that will allow you yo use it in conjunction with Black Studio TinyMCE Widget.

= How to embed video and other contents =

WordPress has a nice [autoembed feature](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) that allows you to embed videos and other stuff in an easy way, by just putting the URL in the content area. This is also possible for widgets created with this plugin.
If you are using a version of WordPress prior to 4.0 or a version of Black Studio TinyMCE Widget prior to 2.0, for best results it is recommended to put the URL inside an `[embed]` shortcode. Example: 
`
[embed]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXXXX[/embed]
`
Ensure that the URL has not an hyperlink on it.
Alternatively, if you don't want to use `[embed]` shortcode, ensure that the URL is not surrounded by a `<p>` tag.

= How to customize widget appearance =

The appearance of widgets in the frontend depends on both CSS and HTML. The plugin does not insert any additional CSS to your website frontend, so if you need to customize the styling of your widget elements, you'll have to do at theme level, or you have to explicitely insert `<style>` tags in your widget text using the the HTML mode (this method is not recommended).
If you need to add CSS classes to widgets we recommend the [Widget CSS Classes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-css-classes/) plugin.
The HTML markup is controlled mainly by WordPress and by the theme, and in a smaller part by the plugin.

The HTML output of a widget includes the following parts:
`
{before_widget}
	{before_title}
		{widget_title}
	{after_title}
	{before_text}
		{widget_text}
	{after_text}
{after_widget}
`
These elements can be customized as follows:

* The `{widget_title}` and `{widget_text}` are the values inserted into the widget fields.
* The markup  of `{before_widget}`, `{after_widget}`, `{before_title}`, `{after_title}` is usually defined by your theme when registering a sidebar with the [`register_sidebar`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_sidebar) function. 
* The `{before_text}` and `{after_text}` are the only pieces of HTML markup added by the plugin. The default markup is the same as native WordPress text widgets to ensure styling compatibility with CSS created for text widgets: `<div class="textwidget"> {text} </div>`. You may customize this markup using the `black_studio_tinymce_before_text` and `black_studio_tinymce_after_text` filter hooks. They both take two parameters: the first is the default text and the second is the widget instance. See examples below.

Example 1: Custom markup for `{before_text}` and `{after_text}` elements
`
add_filter( 'black_studio_tinymce_before_text', 'my_widget_before_text', 10, 2 );
function my_widget_before_text( $before_text, $instance ) {
	return '<div class="mytextwidget">';
}
add_filter( 'black_studio_tinymce_after_text', 'my_widget_after_text', 10, 2 );
function my_widget_after_text( $after_text, $instance ) {
	return '</div>';
}
`

Example 2: Totally remove markup for `[before_text]` and `[after_text]` elements
`
add_filter( 'black_studio_tinymce_before_text', '__return_empty_string' );
add_filter( 'black_studio_tinymce_after_text', '__return_empty_string' );
`

There's also an additional hook, that you may use to specify to not display widgets if their content is empty:
`
add_filter( 'black_studio_tinymce_hide_empty', '__return_true' );
`

= How to customize widget contents (using hooks) =

You may alter widget title and text via code using the `widget_title` and `widget_text` filter hooks (see [Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference#Widgets) for details).
The plugin also internally uses `widget_text` filter to apply specific WordPress native features:

* [`autoembed`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) (priority 4): converts embed urls to relevant embed codes.
* [`convert_smilies`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/convert_smilies) (priority 6): converts text equivalent of smilies to images.
* [`wpautop`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wpautop) (priority 8): applies paragraphs automatically (if the relevant option is selected).
* [`do_shortcode`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) (priority 10): processes the shortcodes.
* [`wp_make_content_images_responsive`](http://wpseek.com/function/wp_make_content_images_responsive/) (priority 12): makes images responsive.

Moreover there are additional filters specific for 3rd party plugins:

* [`icl_t`](http://wpml.org/documentation/support/translation-for-texts-by-other-plugins-and-themes/) (priority 2): applies WPML translation (used only if WPML + WPML String Translation are activated on the site and WPML Widgets is not activated - See FAQ about multi-language sites for further information).
* [`M_Attach_To_Post::substitute_placeholder_imgs`] (priority 10): replaces NextGEN Gallery placeholder images with galleries/slideshows (used only if the NextGEN Gallery plugin is activated).

If for any reason you need to remove the filters above, you may use the following code snippets (or a customized version, depending on your needs):

`
add_action( 'init', 'remove_bstw_widget_text_filters' );
function remove_bstw_widget_text_filters() {
    if ( function_exists( 'bstw' ) ) {
        remove_filter( 'widget_text', array( bstw()->text_filters(), 'autoembed' ), 4 );
        remove_filter( 'widget_text', array( bstw()->text_filters(), 'convert_smilies' ), 6 );
        remove_filter( 'widget_text', array( bstw()->text_filters(), 'wpautop' ), 8 );
        remove_filter( 'widget_text', array( bstw()->text_filters(), 'do_shortcode' ), 10 );
        remove_filter( 'widget_text', array( bstw()->text_filters(), 'wp_make_content_images_responsive' ), 12 );
    }
}
`

`
add_action( 'init', 'remove_bstw_widget_text_plugin_filters' );
function remove_bstw_widget_text_plugin_filters() {
    if ( function_exists( 'bstw' ) ) {
        remove_filter( 'widget_text', array( bstw()->compatibility()->module( 'wpml' ), 'widget_text' ), 2 );
        remove_filter( 'widget_text', array( bstw()->compatibility()->module( 'nextgen_gallery' ), 'widget_text' ) );
    }
}
`

= Plugin's data storage and cleanup =

Plugin's data is stored in serialized format inside a record in the `wp_options` table having `option_name` = `'widget_black-studio-tinymce'`. Data storage is handled by WordPress and not directly by the plugin. The widgets data is intentionally kept in the datatbase upon plugin deactivation / deletion to avoid content loss. If you want to totally remove the plugin including its data, just remove that record after plugin removal.
